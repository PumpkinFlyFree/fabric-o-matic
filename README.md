# fabric-o-matic
Nodeware add-on for constructing woven fabric textures in Blender

The add-on provides set of shader nodes useful to construct procedural textures of various woven fabric.
The main concern is to model fabric structure and to provide maximal procedural flexibility.
The accompanying `samples.blend` contains some sample materials and patterns build with the nodes.

All the nodes and sample materials are available via 'add' menu in shader node editor.
Documentation of the nodes is currently available only in [source files](addon/nodes).
